Deep learning, which is especially formidable in handling big data, has achieved great success in various fields, including bioinformatics. With the advances of the big data era in biology, it is foreseeable that deep learning will become increasingly important in the field and will be incorporated in vast majorities of analysis pipelines.

To facilitate the process, in this repository, we provide eight examples, which cover five research directions, four data types, and a number of deep learning models that people will encounter in Bioinformatics. The five research directions are: sequence analysis, structure prediction and reconstruction, biomolecular property and function prediction, biomedical image processing and diagnosis, biomolecule interaction prediction and systems biology. The four data types are: structured data, 1D sequence data, 2D image or profiling data, graph data. The covered deep learning models are: deep fully connected neural networks, ConvNet, RNN, graph convolutional neural network, ResNet, GAN, VAE.
